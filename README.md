## Problems Tested

### 1. Trapping Rain Water
- **Problem Type**: Array manipulation, Two pointers
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Problem Statement**: Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

#### Solution Comparison

| Metric | Codex (GPT-4) | GitHub Copilot |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Lines of Code | 19 | 24 |
| Time Complexity | O(n) | O(n) |
| Space Complexity | O(1) | O(n) |
| Execution Time (avg) | 1.2e-6s | 2.8e-6s |
| Memory Usage | ~98.8 MiB | ~98.9 MiB |
| Approach | Two-pointer | Dynamic Programming |

## Performance Analysis

### Time Efficiency
- Codex solution performs better on small inputs
- For large inputs (100x size):
  - Codex: ~0.0001s
  - Copilot: ~0.0002s

### Code Complexity
- **Codex**:
  - Lines: 19
  - Functions: 1
  - Loops: 1
  - Conditionals: 2
  
- **Copilot**:
  - Lines: 24
  - Functions: 1
  - Loops: 3
  - Conditionals: 1

### Memory Usage
Both solutions show similar memory profiles, with baseline memory usage around 98.8-98.9 MiB.

## Key Findings

1. **Solution Approach**:
   - Codex: Preferred two-pointer approach, more space-efficient
   - Copilot: Used dynamic programming with auxiliary arrays

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Codex: More concise implementation
   - Copilot: More verbose but potentially more readable

3. **Performance**:
   - Codex solution generally performs better in terms of execution time
   - Memory usage is comparable between both solutions

## Visualizations

The project generates several visualizations for analysis:
- Execution time comparison (boxplots)
- Code complexity metrics (bar charts)
- Memory usage profiles

You can find these visualizations in the `results/analysis/` directory.

## Setup and Usage

1. Create virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up API keys:
   - Create `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
     ```

4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   python scripts/codex_test.py
   python scripts/analysis.py
   ```

## Future Improvements

1. Add more test cases and problem types
2. Implement automated Copilot solution collection
3. Add more performance metrics
4. Create interactive visualization dashboard
